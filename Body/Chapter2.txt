\section{Multi-axial Stress States of Circular CFST member}


\subsection{Multi-axial Stress States}
When the CFST members were under loading, composite effects were introduced due to the interaction between concrete core and steel tube. Thus, both the concrete and steel are under multi-axial stress state.

Regarding the concrete, the steel tube will provide confined stress to it and make the material under tri-axial stress state, which is called concrete confinement effect. The strength and the ductility of the concrete is improved by the confinement effect. There were many researchers had studied the concrete confinement effect for CFST members ().

Not only concrete core, but also the steel tube is under multi-axial stress state. The steel tube will provide the confined stress to the concrete core and introduce the confinement effect. In turn, the concrete will expand under axial stress and cause the circumferential stress (or called hoop stress) around the steel tube. As the thickness of the steel tube is relatively small compared to the section diameter, the steel tube could be considered as a 2D shell and the material is under bi-axial stress state (\cite{RN31}). Figure \ref{fig:steel_biaxial_stress} shows the stress state of the steel tube of circular CFST member. Since the member is under bending force, part of the steel tube is under compression and part of it is under tension. The influences of bi-axial stress state on the steel material properties in the compression and tension areas are different. As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:steel_biaxial_stress}, for the compression area, the steel is combined with compressive stress on vertical direction and tensile stress on the horizontal direction. While for the tension area, the steel is under tensile stress at both vertical and horizontal directions.

To consider the yield stress of steel under bi-axial stress state, the yield surface is introduced (Figure \ref{fig:von_mises}). It should be noted that, positive value stands for tensile stress whilst negative value presents compressive stress. The hoop stress (\(\sigma_h\)) is plotted at the positive \(x\) axis and the corresponding steel yield stresses under compression (\(f_{yc}\)) and tension (\(f_{yt}\)) are annotated on the yield surface. It could be found that, for steel at compression area, the compressive yield stress is smaller than the uni-axial yield stress (\(f_{y}\)), which will have negative influence on the CFST member capacity. On the contrary, the steel yield stress at tension area will be larger than the uni-axial yield stress, which would benefit the member strength under bending. For circular CFST member under pure compression loading, the whole steel section is under compression and the yield stress of the steel is reduced from (\(f_{y}\)) to (\(f_{yc}\)), Therefore, the steel bi-axial stress has negative influence on the CFST column’s compressive resistance capacity. But for the bending capacity of CFST member, the influence of the steel bi-axial stress state depends on the relative area between the compression part and tension part, since the bi-axial stress state can increase yield stress under tension and reduce yield stress under compression. Thus, if the tensile area of the steel section is larger than the compressive, the steel bi-axial stress will benefit the bending resistance capacity of the CFST members and vice versa.

\subsection{Influence of Multi-axial stress state on Bending Capacity}

As the multi-axial stress states of CFST members consists of concrete confinement effect and steel bi-axial stress state. The combination of the two states could be complex. To study the influence of the multi-axial stress states on bending capacity of circular CFST member, experiment tests were conducted and numerical models were developed.

Experimental tests, which were detailed in \cite{Silva2016}, had been conducted to study characterize the bending behaviour of the circular CFST columns under flexural loading. Based on the test results, two numerical models, namely a 3D Finite Element (FE) model and a Distributed Plasticity (DP) model had been proposed to simulate the bending behaviour of circular CFST members. The details of the two numerical models, including the member geometry, the steel-concrete interaction and the material properties, could be found in \cite{Jiang2018}. The accuracy of the two models had been validated against the test results and the corresponding lateral load versus drift ratio plots of the eight specimens are showing in Figure \ref{fig:test_vs_FE}. The 3D FE model can predict accurate bending behaviour of CFST member, since the local buckling, material interaction and the material strength under multi-axial stress, could be captured by the model. Regarding DP model, it was found that the model was always giving lower capacity prediction compared to the test results. The reason of the lower prediction could be considered as the multi-axial stress state.
